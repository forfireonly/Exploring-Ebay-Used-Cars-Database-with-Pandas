# Exploring-Ebay-Used-Cars-Database-with-Pandas

I applied a variety of pandas methods to explore and understand a data set on car listings.

I worked with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data)
was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle.
